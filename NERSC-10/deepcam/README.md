This repository contains some original scripts and my modifications to DeepCAM AI benchmark to adjust it for running on Azure. The benchmark belongs to NERSC and can be obtained from [NERSC-10 (N10) Workflow benchmark suite](https://www.nersc.gov/systems/nersc-10/benchmarks). <br>

To run the actual benchmark, please refer to the original repo.
